# eficiencia

- What?

A Dart Flutter to-do list application that, in addition to the basics, also gives feedback to the user about how efficient the planning is and also how over a period you have improved or worsened in your planning.

- Why?

The purpose of this app is to solve something that bothered me whenever I used Microsoft Todo List: And when I don't do what I set out to do? Just delete or reset? So I wanted to create an app that gives this feedback to the user about what is predicted versus what is accomplished. Giving data that allow the user to know how their time management / planning.
